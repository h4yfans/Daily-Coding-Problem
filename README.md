# Daily Challange Problems and Solutions

Get exceptionally good at coding interviews by solving one problem every day


### What is Daily Coding Problem?

Daily Coding Problem is a simple and very useful platform that emails you one coding problem to solve every morning. This ensures that you practice consistently and often enough to stay in shape over a long period of time.

Practicing just one problem a day is enough to make a huge impact on your skill-set and confidence, especially when faced with a task that you might be facing in a top-tier tech company in the near future.

Daily Coding Problem contains a wide variety of questions inspired by real programming interviews, with in-depth solutions that clearly take you through each core concept. You'll learn about:

-   Arrays
-   Strings
-   Linked Lists
-   Trees
-   Hash Tables
-   Binary Search Trees
-   Tries
-   Heaps
-   Stacks and Queues
-   Graphs
-   Randomized Algorithms
-   Dynamic Programming
-   Backtracking
-   Bit Manipulation
-   Pathfinding
-   Recursion
-   Data Structure Design
-   System Design

### Which Programming Languages?
Currently, DCP provides solutions in Python as it is very well-known and similar to pseudo-code, as well as being simple to learn. This seems to be a good choice for solutions since Python code is fairly easy to translate to other languages, given its simple syntax and straight-forward programming style.
