##Daily Coding Problem #16



This problem was asked by Twitter.

You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last `N` `order` ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

*   record(order\_id): adds the order\_id to the log
*   get\_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.

You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.
